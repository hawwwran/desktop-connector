# Architecture Decisions

This file is the long-term tracker for **non-trivial architectural
decisions** in Desktop Connector. When a choice would otherwise force a
future maintainer to re-derive the reasoning from code or commit
history — protocol shape, persistence strategy, security boundary,
cross-runtime contract, irreversible data-format pick, dependency
adoption / removal — write it down here.

This complements (not replaces) the existing surfaces:

- `CLAUDE.md` → the "Key design decisions" section captures the legacy
  / cross-cutting decisions in narrative form. Going forward, *new*
  decisions land **here** as discrete dated entries; CLAUDE.md gets a
  one-liner pointer when relevant.
- `docs/plans/` → working notes for in-flight features; ephemeral.
- `docs/protocol/` → the wire spec; describes what is, not why.
- `docs/diagnostics.events.md` → emitted-event catalog.
- `temp/vault-found-issues/` (gitignored) → review backlog tracker.

## When to add an entry

Yes:

- Choosing a wire format, encryption mode, or AAD shape.
- Settling on a state machine (e.g. transfer phases, sync binding
  states, migration recovery transitions).
- Picking between two non-obvious implementations and rejecting the
  other on durable grounds.
- Adding / removing a dependency or build tool.
- Changing a security boundary or threat-model assumption.
- Adopting a backwards-incompatible behaviour gate.

No (skip the entry, just commit normally):

- Bug fixes that restore intended behaviour.
- Single-call refactors / renames / cleanups.
- UI copy or styling tweaks.
- Test reorganisation.
- Anything fully captured by a clear commit message + the code it
  changes.

## Entry format

Each entry is a level-3 heading dated `YYYY-MM-DD`. The body is short —
prose, not bullets — and answers four questions:

1. **What** did we decide.
2. **Why** that and not something else (the rejected alternatives).
3. **Where** the decision is anchored in code (paths, key functions).
4. **Status** — `accepted` / `superseded by <date>` / `deprecated`.

Newer entries go on top so the latest decisions are visible without
scrolling.

### Template — copy this for new entries

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — Short title (verb-led, ≤ 70 chars)

**Status:** accepted.

**Context.** What problem we're solving and why now.

**Decision.** What we chose. One paragraph max.

**Alternatives.** What we rejected and why — the bit future-you will
want when arguing whether to flip the decision.

**Anchor.** Files / functions / commits that implement it.
```
